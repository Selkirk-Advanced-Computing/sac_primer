# Dual Boot Ubuntu & Windows
Dual-Booting
: Two operating systems installed on a single PC

Dual booting works by splitting a hard drive with an existing operating system (OS) into multiple **partitions** and installing another OS into the newly created partition. Each partition is separate from the others and contained unless specially accessed. Once the computer is dual booting, a boot manager will allow the user to choose which OS to boot at each startup. It's also possible to boot from a portable OS on a portable memory drive with either the boot manager or your Basic Input Output System (BIOS).

If you prefer to follow official documentation, here are the[Ubuntu Docs](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot) describing the process. You will doubtlessly require further resources to complete the process.
